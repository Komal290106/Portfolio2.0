# Komal 2.0 - Gamified Developer Portfolio

Komal 2.0 isn’t just a portfolio — it’s an experience.  
I wanted to build something that felt playful, interactive, and uniquely *me*, and that’s how this game-themed, pixel-styled developer showcase was born.

Every section comes with smooth transitions, animated UI elements, and even a hidden easter egg 👀  
Built with a modern stack, this portfolio demonstrates my focus on aesthetic design, responsiveness, and delightful user interaction.
